## About the Project

This repository serves to provide a basic understanding of how to use the data collection framework. It runs on **ROS2 Foxy** and enables testing of noise-sensitive path planning algorithms for drones using real-time acoustic and positional data.

The goal is to enable testing of advanced algorithms like **RRT\*** and **CLF-CBF** that optimize drone trajectories for reduced noise pollution in urban environments.

---

## Framework Overview

The data collection framework incorporates **3 Python scripts** that collect and process different types of data:

* **`mic12_Audio_capture.py`**
  Creates 12 publishers (one per microphone) to publish audio data to topics `db_data1` to `db_data12` every 0.1 seconds. It starts 12 threads and input streams for simultaneous recording. Data is buffered in 15-second chunks saved as temporary `.bin` files. Upon shutdown, these are converted to `.wav` files.

* **`mic12_CSV_logger.py`**
  Subscribes to microphone and Tello positions from VRPN client nodes, and to audio data from the `db_dataX` topics. Computes decibel values for each microphone every 0.1 seconds and logs decibels, positions, and distances to a CSV file.

* **`mic12_Audio_plotter.py`**
  Subscribes to audio data topics and provides live visualization of audio levels from all 12 microphones using matplotlib subplots.

* **`tellocontroller.py`**
  Used to command the drone along predefined paths (e.g., `move_forward(x)`, `rotate_counter_clockwise(90)`).

All scripts are launched simultaneously using a **ROS2 launch file package**.

## Data Collected

* **CSV files** containing timestamps, positions, distances, and decibel levels
* **Audio files** (.wav) from each test condition
* **Plots** visualizing amplitude, decibel, and distance over time

## Methodology

* 12 microphones positioned at various heights and locations
* Motion capture (Motive) for positional tracking
* ROS1-ROS2 bridge for communication
* Python scripts for data collection, logging, and plotting
* Tests under different environmental setups (normal, dampened, various heights, mic caps on/off)
